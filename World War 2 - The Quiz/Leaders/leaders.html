        <h2>Leaders</h2>
        <h3>This page aims to give you some very basic details about each of the leaders of the main Allied and Axis nations. The nations in question are only those active at the end of the war, 
            and so will not include France. However, it is important to recognise the important role the faction of Free France played in the allied victory, particularly in the
            liberation of Axis-controlled African nations.</h3>
